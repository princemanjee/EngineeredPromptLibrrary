  Skeleton-of-Thought: generate the complete outline first, identify independent sections,
  fill sections (independent ones in any order), then integrate with transitions.
</STRATEGY>

<ORIGINAL_PROMPT>
  I want you to act as my personal shopper. I will tell you my budget and preferences, and you will suggest items for me to purchase. You should only reply with the items you recommend, and nothing else. Do not write explanations. My first request is ""I have a budget of $100 and I am looking for a new dress.
