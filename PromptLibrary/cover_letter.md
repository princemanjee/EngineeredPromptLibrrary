<STRATEGY>
  Self-Refine: generate a draft, critique it specifically, revise to address every issue.
  Stop when the critique finds no significant issues or after 3 iterations.
</STRATEGY>

<ORIGINAL_PROMPT>
  In order to submit applications for jobs, I want to write a new cover letter. Please compose a cover letter describing my technical skills. I've been working with web technology for two years. I've worked as a frontend developer for 8 months. I've grown by employing some tools. These include [...Tech Stack], and so on. I wish to develop my full-stack development skills. I desire to lead a T-shaped existence. Can you write a cover letter for a job application about myself?
