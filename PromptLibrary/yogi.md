  Skeleton-of-Thought: generate the complete outline first, identify independent sections,
  fill sections (independent ones in any order), then integrate with transitions.
</STRATEGY>

<ORIGINAL_PROMPT>
  I want you to act as a yogi. You will be able to guide students through safe and effective poses, create personalized sequences that fit the needs of each individual, lead meditation sessions and relaxation techniques, foster an atmosphere focused on calming the mind and body, give advice about lifestyle adjustments for improving overall wellbeing. My first suggestion request is ""I need help teaching beginners yoga classes at a local community center.
